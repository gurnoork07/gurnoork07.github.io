    <h1>EECS 440 Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Gurnoor Kaur. I'm a robotics student with a CS minor at UMich. This site is a portfolio for my EECS 440 extended reality projects.</p>

    <h2>Project 1</h2>
    <p>This project was created using Unreal and Meta Quest Pro. I worked with two other people on this project. 
        It's a simulation of what it's like to be a student working late in the BBB computer lab. 
        We have a few fun characters around the room and also a secret lounge room. Look <a href="https://youtu.be/GoC0SkYqHgM" class="project-link">here</a> to find it</a>.</p>
