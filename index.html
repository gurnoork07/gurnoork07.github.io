    <h1>EECS 440 Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Gurnoor Kaur, and I'm a robotics student with a CS minor at the University of Michigan. This site showcases my exciting journey through the EECS 440 Extended Reality projects.</p>

    <h2>Project 1: Late Night Lab Adventure</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my first project, crafted using Unreal Engine and the Meta Quest Pro. 
        I worked with two other students to create an immersive simulation that captures the experience of being a student working late nights BBB computer lab. </p>
    <p>As you explore the lab, you’ll encounter a cast of characters that bring the environment to life, and if you’re adventurous enough, 
        you might just discover a secret lounge room hidden within! Ready to dive in? Look <a href="https://youtu.be/GoC0SkYqHgM" >here</a> to find it!</p>
    
        <h3>Project 2: Ann Arbor Go</h3>
        <p>This is the second project I have worked on in this class, focusing on augmented reality. It was developed using Unity and collaborating with one other person. </p>
        <p>The project invites users to explore Ann Arbor through an interactive map, discovering landmarks, planting trees, and enjoying fun, spooky games.
